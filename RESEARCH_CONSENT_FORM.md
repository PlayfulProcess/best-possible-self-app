# Product Improvement Consent

## Purpose

We want to improve our AI coaching and journaling features to make them more helpful for you and other users. By choosing "Research Consent," you're helping us understand what works well and what could be better.

## What We Use Your Data For

When you choose "Research Consent," we use your anonymized data to:

- **Improve AI Responses**: Make the AI assistant more helpful and relevant
- **Better Features**: Understand which features users find most valuable
- **Fix Problems**: Identify and resolve issues in the app
- **Usage Insights**: Learn how people use the app to guide improvements

### Privacy Protection
- Your name and email are never included in our analysis
- All personal details are removed before we look at the data
- We only look at patterns across many users, not individual stories
- Data is stored securely and only accessed by our product team

## What We Don't Use

- Content marked as "Private Mode" or "Save Privately" - we never see this
- Your personal information (name, email, etc.)
- Payment or account details

## Completely Optional

- This is 100% voluntary - you can use the app without this
- You can change your mind anytime by switching your privacy setting
- Your app experience won't change whether you consent or not
- To stop: just change from "Research Consent" to any other privacy option

## Why This Helps

- You help make the AI assistant better for everyone

- The app becomes more useful over time
- Very low risk - same security as regular app use

## How We Keep Your Data Safe

- Only our product team has access
- We never share individual user content
- All data stays within our company for product improvement only

## What This Means
