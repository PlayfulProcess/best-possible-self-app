MANUAL TEST CHECKLIST FOR CHAT PERSISTENCE:

1. TEST: Chat persists when switching windows/tabs
   - Open the app and start a new journal entry
   - Open AI chat and send a message
   - Switch to another tab/window and back
   - EXPECTED: Chat messages should still be there

2. TEST: Chat persists when switching between entries  
   - Create a journal entry with chat messages
   - Save the entry
   - Create a new entry
   - Go back to the original entry
   - EXPECTED: Original chat messages should reload

3. TEST: Chat persists during first save (null -> ID transition)
   - Start writing and chatting without saving
   - Save the entry for the first time
   - EXPECTED: Chat messages should remain, not disappear

4. TEST: Session storage backup for new entries
   - Start a new entry without signing in or saving
   - Add chat messages
   - Refresh the page
   - EXPECTED: Chat should be restored from sessionStorage

5. TEST: Chat clearing when creating new entry
   - Have an entry with chat messages loaded
   - Click "New Entry" 
   - EXPECTED: Chat should clear for fresh start

6. TEST: Auth-dependent features
   - Try tool without signing in
   - Attempt to save or change privacy settings
   - EXPECTED: Should prompt to sign in but allow tool usage

AUTOMATED TEST SETUP (Future):
- Install Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
- Test chat persistence across browser actions
- Test sessionStorage backup/restore
- Test auth prompts and redirects

RUN MANUAL TESTS:
1. npm run dev
2. Go through each test case above
3. Report any failures in GitHub issues
