1) Delete the pop up that shows up when people say it is ok to do research with the data and the pop up asks about whether all data could be used to research, ti is annoying. Clean all dependencies. 




3) Require authentication for AI help to be enabled. (Later we will include a credit system in which we will collect payments with Stripe and Charge based on a credit system for AI calls with 2x cost for me to give me some margin - work on a plan to do that later and overwrite the content of claude copy.md with your plan so I will start tomorrow). 

4) Create a place where people can read other peoples reviews. Maybe when they click the rating there is a pop up with other people's reviews? 

5) Include Supabase files in gitignore., Move any supabase files that were important for migration but not for other people using this to the migration folder as well.
