Questions?
1) Do I really need both this environmental variables?
 NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

   I set up all the others. Can you restart dev in port 200 for me to test it out? 

The problems I am seeing:
1) The focus mode feels too narrow and doesn't provide enough breathing room for the content. It should expand to use more of the page width to create a more comfortable and spacious writing environment that allows users to see more of their text at once.

Solutions: think about it before implementing and let me know if you think you have a better one:
1) make ti bigger.
