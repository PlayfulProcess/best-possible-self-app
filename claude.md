First of all, I love you.
Can you check if databases in Supabase are looking like you anticipated?

Second:
1) Commit and push
2) ORdering by Newest and Rating are working. Popular apparently is not. 
3) Can you get a better gradient color or pattern for the thumbnails that do not have an image? 
4) All the greys that appear as a text where people input text are too light apparetnly. Especially the ones in review. Rate this tool, and forms Share a Tool and Collaborate with Us. They are also not changing colors when I write on them. 
Your rating





Review (optional)

5) I tried rating something. There was a refresh in the page like something was loading, but the rating did not show yet in the page. Check if the flow for rating is working and if we have the apropriate fields in the database. I looked into the databse and it did not update in Supabase. 

6) Include a beta note in the Header To. Let's call it just Jongu (Use logo in the public folder) in the header (delete Tool Garden) . Also delete the category "Categories" with dropdown from the header. 

7) For the footer change:
from:
Jongu Tool Garden
Community-powered emotional wellness

To: 
Jongu (Use logo in the public folder)
Community-powered emotional wellness. Building gateways, not gatekeepers


8) Transform the link Try Our Tools into a link alike the others (Browse Tools

Categories
Share a Tool
About) . The Text should Say "Try Tool")

9) Add a sign in  button in the place where Try Our Tools currently is. 

10) In teh contat form, isntead of writing Tyr BEst Possible Self, say "Try Featured Tool", as it will likely change.

11) Tools can be from anywhere in the internet. Not just claude. Change text and validation logic. Claude.ai URL *. I want to include:
The Artist Way
https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Morning-Pages-Journal/dp/0874778867#:~:text=The%20idea%20behind%20Julia%20Cameron's,becoming%20your%20most%20creative%20self.
Not just one tool, but several to boost creativity. My favorite is morning pages: write 3 pages of the first things to mind as soon as you wake up. It declutters the mind, open up doors to dream and imagination.

12) In the collaboration form there is a type appearing. Instead of We'll be in touch soon, it renders We@apos;lll. Change it to We will. 

13) Maybe the colaboration form table was not created? I did not find anything...

14) In the thumbnail form submission, explain ideal size and image rendering for people to have some idea of how they will show up before they submit. 

15) In the authentication pop up that I click to save my work, if I login into github, I loose all my data. So add an additional popup before authenticating through GIthub and ask if the person is sure, because they will loose their work so far. 

16) When I authenticated with email and password, the text of the journaling was preserved, but I lost the AI chat. PLease fix that. 

WHen you are done, list all the things I need to validate before pushing.
