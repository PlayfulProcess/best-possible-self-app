1) Save a new branch for dev
2) set this up for Supabase authentication - the HIPAA compliant one
3) Help me get the simplest way to save what people write and chat on Supabase
4) Give people a choice of how they want to make their data public (private mode - nothing get saved, save for later with privacy settings, make it available for public to comments on like a blog post (we will create that later), and separately: authorize us to use it to refine model or just use as history for the AI to search for when using the app) choose best approach between multiple or single selection with the right categories. You can use a better approach that people will understand and that is easy to implement. For now. It can be a column in the database and later we build the processes around it.
5) create todo list to make the data privacy settings actually workk
6) create legal documents and policies that people would expect in an app like this.
