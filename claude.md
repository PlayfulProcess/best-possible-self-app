1) the color of the text when I type is too light of a grey, the same color used for the text there before I start writing. Same apply to AI chatbot, where I write, it is too light, as well as where it is rendered. 
2) Research consent should be a Toggle independent of the others, as it is independent of view. But maybe just enabled outside of PRivate mode?
3) where do people choose to save? Where is the call to save data in Supabase?
4) should I enable auth in SUpabase, the HIPAA version?
a) Auth failed with github: {"code":400,"error_code":"validation_failed","msg":"Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled"}
b) auth failed with Google: {"code":400,"error_code":"validation_failed","msg":"Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled"}
