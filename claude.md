The problems I am seeing:
1) BRowse tools is going to an older version page. Why is this happening?
2) I am no longer seeing the form for creators and I already created the Supabase table


Solutions: think about it before implementing and let me know if you think you have a better one:
1) if it is easier, take out the button for now, as well as the page that it is linking to. It should be just a scrol down, right? 
2) get the creator form back in there! Thanks!
