old ones:

1) Can you get a better gradient color or pattern for the thumbnails that do not have an image? 
2) Change colors of text appearing in chatbox where people input data to black. 
3) Can you replace the word "Jongu" for the logo Jongu that I pasted in the public folder?




4) For the footer change:
Delete thrid row:

Replace: Community-powered emotional wellness

 5) In the end of the contat form, isntead of writing in the second button Try BEst Possible Self, say "Try Featured Tool", as it will likely change.

6) I tried submitting a new tool and there was an error: ‚ùå Failed to submit tool. Please try again.

Not just one tool, but several to boost creativity. My favorite is morning pages: write 3 pages of the first things to mind as soon as you wake up. It declutters the mind, open up doors to dream and imagination.

7) I submitted a collaboration form but the database did not get any update. (provider_signups) 

8) In the authentication pop up that I click to save my work, if I login into github, I loose all my data. So add an additional popup before authenticating through GIthub and ask if the person is sure, because they will loose their work so far. 

9) When I authenticated with email and password, the text of the journaling was preserved, but I lost the AI chat. PLease fix that. 

WHen you are done, list all the things I need to validate before pushing.
