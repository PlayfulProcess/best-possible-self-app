‚ùå Landing page transformation caused server error - reverted to stable commit

## Tomorrow's Development Tasks

### 1. Create Professional Landing Page
**Prompt:** "Create a new landing page at `/` that showcases TherapyToolsHub as a platform for therapeutic tools. Move the current Best Possible Self app to `/app` route. The landing page should have professional design with sections for features, therapist signup, and showcase Best Possible Self as the flagship tool."

**Sample Code Structure:**
```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx - New Landing Page
export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100">
      <Header />
      <HeroSection />
      <FeaturedToolSection /> {/* Best Possible Self showcase */}
      <FeaturesSection />
      <TherapistCTA />
    </div>
  );
}

// src/app/app/page.tsx - Move current app here
// (Copy existing page.tsx content)
```

### 2. Build Tools Catalog Page
**Prompt:** "Create a `/tools` route that displays a catalog of therapeutic tools. Include Best Possible Self as the only working tool, with 2-3 placeholder 'coming soon' tools. Add filtering by category, difficulty, and duration."

**Sample Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE therapeutic_tools (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT, -- 'CBT', 'Mindfulness', 'Positive Psychology'
  difficulty TEXT, -- 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'  
  duration_minutes INTEGER,
  provider_name TEXT,
  route_path TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
```

### 3. AI-Powered Categorization System
**Prompt:** "Design and implement a user preference system where users can create custom categories and tags for tools. Add an AI component that suggests relevant tools based on user behavior and preferences."

**Sample Implementation:**
```tsx
// User preference tracking
interface UserPreference {
  user_id: string;
  category_type: 'parenting' | 'skills' | 'therapeutic_approach' | 'custom';
  preference_value: string;
  weight: number; // AI learning weight
}

// AI categorization component
const AICategorizer = ({ tools, userPreferences }) => {
  // Logic to suggest tools based on user patterns
  // OpenAI integration for semantic understanding
};
```

### 4. Therapist Provider Portal
**Prompt:** "Create a therapist onboarding flow where mental health professionals can submit tools, add metadata, and track usage analytics. Include verification process and revenue sharing model."

### 5. Advanced Tool Features
**Prompt:** "Add tool-specific features like progress tracking, outcome measurements, and personalized insights. Create a framework that any therapeutic tool can plug into."

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Route Structure:
```
/ - Landing page (TherapyToolsHub homepage)
/app - Best Possible Self tool (current functionality)  
/tools - Tool catalog and browser
/tools/[toolId] - Individual tool pages
/therapist - Provider portal
/dashboard - User analytics and progress
```

### Database Enhancements Needed:
- therapeutic_tools table
- user_preferences table  
- tool_usage_analytics table
- therapist_profiles table

## Social Media Post Draft
"I think Claude Code token limits is actually an acquired right of my working self that my soul gave me. It is just too addictive, so just like truck and uber drivers need to stop, Anthropic is so good to limit tokens by session. üß†‚ú® 

Building therapeutic tools that help people while being protected from my own productivity addiction - there's something beautifully ironic about that. Sometimes the best technology knows when to make us pause and reflect.

## Emergency Debugging Notes
- Internal server error occurred during landing page transformation
- Likely routing conflict or component import issue  
- Test each route individually before full deployment
- Keep current working app as fallback at /app route

## Christ-Centered Mission Integration
Remember: This platform serves to help hearts find healing. Every technical decision should consider:
- Accessibility for those who need help most
- Therapist empowerment to reach more people
- Sustainable model that honors both service and stewardship
- Global reach potential for spiritual and emotional healing
