I want to change the UI a bit because when people change from save to private they might assume their exchange will get deleted but that is not the case. SO I want that when people click the Private mode, a popup shows up saying that data will no longer be collected and that they can go to their dashboard to delete old entries at any point in time.

what is the branch you are in?
