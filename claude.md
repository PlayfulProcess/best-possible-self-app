The problems I am seeing:
1) I dont want to be liable by HIPAA things and regulation that goes into therapy.
2) the chat with AI still disappears when I go into another window and come back.
3)Github auth still not working locally.
4) I dnont know how to create new SUpabase tbale.
5) VErcel is not being able to deploy the app: 294:15  Error: Do not use an `<a>` element to navigate to `/`. Use `<Link />` from `next/link` instead. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-html-link-for-pages  @next/next/no-html-link-for-pages
6) CHat conversation is still disappearing when I get out of the browser window. 
7) language is still very mental health focused. Think more headspace, sounds true language https://www.soundstrue.com/ or this: https://claude-app-store3.vercel.app/. Also, make the communication around trust and open source. Provide the Github link: https://github.com/PlayfulProcess/best-possible-self-app


Solutions: think about it before implementing and let me know if you think you have a better one:
1) change language so there is a lower risk for that in the landing page.
2) fix and let me know what you did and potential causes 
4)give me instructions plus a SQL to run there.
