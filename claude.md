Not just one tool, but several to boost creativity. My favorite is morning pages: write 3 pages of the first things to mind as soon as you wake up. It declutters the mind, open up doors to dream and imagination.

7) I submitted a collaboration form but the database did not get any update. (provider_signups) 

8) In the authentication pop up that I click to save my work, if I login into github, I loose all my data. So add an additional popup before authenticating through GIthub and ask if the person is sure, because they will loose their work so far. 

9) When I authenticated with email and password, the text of the journaling was preserved, but I lost the AI chat. PLease fix that. 

WHen you are done, list all the things I need to validate before pushing.
