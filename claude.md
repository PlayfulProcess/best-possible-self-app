# Current Development Tasks

1) Make this window (Welcome to Best Possible Self) only show up as a popup when people click in (Sign in to see your dashboard)
2) In the app, when people click save, open the auth popup and preserve what the user wrote down. Currently, it is being lost.
3) Sign in to save your work

Go back to sign in --> not going back. Just a pop up with auth.

4) Make sure the Welcome to Best Possible Self text is readable, currently too light of a grey over white...
4) sign in with github in the VErcel app is redirecting to local... Is there a wrong environmental variable somewhere: http://localhost:3000/?code=4f7bbc19-fabd-42bb-aa01-2f87edadf7dd
