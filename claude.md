1) Delete this footer or say something like "if using private mode, remember to save your writing in a safe place. It might be helpful to go back and read it every now and then. Sometimes we see that we are closer than we realize to our best possible self, or at least it remind us to keep in the direction we feel right under so many life distractions". 📝 Keep a Record
Print this page or copy your text to keep a record of your best possible self vision and insights.

2) Create a dashboard where users can retrieve their saved files. Maybe it can be the same page but that retrieves the data from Supabase, so they can keep chatting with AI about it?
